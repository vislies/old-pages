								  <h2>VisLies 2016 Gallery</h2>
								  <p>October 25, 2016</p>
								  <p>It was another great year of lying, cheating, and deception during this year's Vis Lies.Â (No, I did not just copy/paste that from last year's web page. Any similarity is purely a coincidence.) We had great attendence this year dispite VisLies happening at the same time as a Vis reception with free food and beer. You guys are kind of crazy for picking VisLies over free beer, but we love you for it. Of couse, that didn't stop Georges, Bernice, and Ken from delaying the start so we could each grab a beer. (Hey, craziness only goes so far.)								  </p>
								  <p>Here is a recap of VisLies this year.</p>
								  <h3 id="politicians">Politicians Lie? No Way!							      </h3>
								  <div class="image-constrain">
							        <p><a href="CandidateLies.png"><img src="CandidateLies_Thumbnail.png" alt="" width="400" height="241" class="image-right"/></a><a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~grinstei/" target="_blank">Georges Grinstein</a> kicked off the meeting with a surprising statistic about our presidential candiates: they lie.</p>
							        <p>I know what you are thinking. Come on, there is no way the leaders of our nation would be dishonest or stoop so low as to resort to mistruthes to get elected. But here are some statistics Georges presented that incontrovertably shows that the candidates vying to be President of the United States sometimes are less than honest (some more than others).</p>
							        <p>I don't know where Georges got these stats, but they must be true if they use such scientific metrics as &quot;Pants On Fire.&quot; (Actually, these numbers look like they come from <a href="http://www.politifact.com/" target="_blank">PolitiFact</a>. They use these descriptions as ratings.)</p>
							      </div>
								   
								  <h3>Some Type of Shenanigans</h3>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="FinancialShenanigansOverview.jpg"><img src="FinancialShenanigansOverview_Thumbnail.png" alt="" width="400" height="262" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>The great thing about a VisLie is that it transcends all languages. <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~grinstei/" target="_blank">Georges Grinstein</a> recently came across <a href="http://visualoop.com/infographics/financial-shenanigans" target="_blank">this</a> rather strange infographic featured in a <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/44004901/Financial-shenanigans" target="_blank">Spanish-language financial magazine</a>. The English translation of the title is &quot;Financial Slips&quot; or &quot;Financial Shenanigans.&quot; The description below that translates to &quot;The government's plan for the next few years is to absorb the increase in pension and debt spending, with lower investment in capital spending. This decision could hit growth.&quot; Does this visualization support this description?</p>
								    <p>Well, the green ribbon represents the increase in pension and retirement spending, which is indeed projected to get larger. Likewise the orange line represents capitol spending, which is projected to get smaller, perhaps in part to offset the cost. But what about the last statement: &quot;This decision could hit growth.&quot; Is that statement justified by the data? There is no measure of growth represented here. If there is justification for this conclusion, it is not represented in this visualization.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="FinancialShenanigansZoom3.png"><img src="FinancialShenanigansZoom3_Thumbnail.png" alt="" width="400" height="273" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>But if we look closer, we notice something strange going on. First, we observe that although the horizontal axis is labeled by year, there is no labeling of the vertical axis. Looking closer, we see that in fact that there is no consistent axis whatsoever. You can see in this zoomed section of the left axis that the labels on the bars go from 2.9 to 1.9 to 5.9. Wha? As we look elsewhere in the graphic we see that everything is inconsistent along the vertical axis. The scales are off as well as the positions.</p>
								  </div>
								  <p><a href="FinancialShenanigansZoom1.png"><img src="FinancialShenanigansZoom1_Thumbnail.png" alt="" class="image-half"/></a><a href="FinancialShenanigansZoom2.png"><img src="FinancialShenanigansZoom2_Thumbnail.png" alt="" class="image-half"/></a></p>
								  <p>So do the data at all support <em>any</em> assertions made? The description in the graphic clearly implies that the predicted drop in capitol is to cover the rise in pension and retirement cost. Below is a simpler graph of the same data using a consistent horizontal axis.</p>
								  <p><a href="FinancialShenanigansTrue.pdf"><img src="FinancialShenanigansTrue.svg" alt="" class="image-full"/></a></p>
								  <p>We see here that the predicted drop in capitol is huge compared to the rise of pension expenses during the same time period. Thus, from the data provided here, it is an extreme stretch to infer that pension costs are the major cause for a drop in capitol.</p>
								  <h3>Fun with Sports Bras</h3>
								  <p>A common error with designing information graphics is the use of odd shapes in place of bars when depecting relative sizes. Although we humans are pretty good at judging the relative length of objects (when they have consistent width), we get easily confused when stretching an area in multiple directions. Unfortunately, graphic designers like to violate this principle by filling interesting shapes to grab attention.</p>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="NikeSportwear.png"><img src="NikeSportwear_Thumbnail.png" alt="" width="400" height="196" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p><a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~grinstei/" target="_blank">Georges Grinstein</a> found a rather odd form of of this vis lie that was used by Nike to report on the effectiveness on web features in selling sportswear. Rather than just show a simple bar chart, this graphic fills in women's sports tops and bottoms. It's hard enough to judge the relative sizes from different fills from the same shape. (Consider for example the top left images filled to 93% and 78%. Without the numbers would you have guessed a 15% difference in fill? Me neither.) But things get even worse when you try to compare values from one shape to another. In particular, the taper of the shape of the bottoms makes all their values look smaller than that of the top.</p>
								    <p>I don't know what is worse about this design: that the shapes thwart the point of the data bymaking it look like the numbers shrink from 2013 to 2014 when in fact they increase or that the image is suggestive of incontinence.</p>
								  </div>
								  <h3>Infant Mortality</h3>
								  <p><a href="http://www.kennethmoreland.com" target="_blank">Ken Moreland</a> found the following infographic, which was originally posted by Sherri Tenpenny in multiple <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/is-there-any-logic-behind-vaccine-claims/" target="_blank">Health Impact News blog</a>. In summary, the graphic shows the U.S. is the nation that injects the most vaccines in newborns and also has the highest infant mortality rate, with the obvious implication that vaccines may be causing adverse health effects in babies.</p>
								  <p><a href="InfantMortalityOriginal.jpg"><img src="InfantMortalityOriginal_Thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="438" class="image-full"/></a></p>
								  <p>After we get over the faulty logic of assuming correlation shows causality (no link between greater vaccinations and greater infant mortality has ever been found), we find something a bit odd about the statement of U.S. infant mortality. Is the U.S. really at the bottom of <em>all</em> countries? Considering the many places in the world with little or no modern health care, that actually seems rather unbelievable.</p>
								  <p><a href="InfantMortalityResponse.png"><img src="InfantMortalityResponse.png" alt="" width="960" height="720" class="image-full"/></a></p>
								  <p>It's unbelievable because it's flat wrong. The U.S. is nowhere near the worse country with regard to infant mortality. In fact, we are quite near the top. The graphic cheats by arbitrarily cutting off the list. Although Tenpenny's visualization makes it look like the U.S. has a very high infant mortality rate, it actually says nothing of the sort. All it says is that the U.S. has a higher infant mortality rate than all countries with a smaller infant mortality rate, which is meaningless.</p>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="InfantMortalityIEEESpectrum.jpeg"><img src="InfantMortalityIEEESpectrum_Thumbnail.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="254" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>The anti-vaccination	community	is	not	exactly	known	for	truthful	visualizations. (We reported on <a href="../../2015/gallery/index.html#measles-vaccine">another vaccination lie</a> at last year's vis lies.)</p>
								    <p>But somehow, the essentially same graphic made it to a source that I would expect would have much higher credentials. The image to the right looks nicer, but it is exactly the same lie. The data are arbitrarily cut off at the U.S. for no reason other than to make it the largest value in the graphic.</p>
								    <p>Care to guess where this graphic comes from? Anyone?</p>
								  </div>
								  <p>This graphic in fact comes from <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/american-exceptionalism" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a>. As the publisher of numerous peer reviewed papers, I am rather horrified that this sham of data presentation made it to its most widely distributed journal.</p>
								  <h3>Axis Scales</h3>
                                  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="ObamacareEnrollment.png"><img src="ObamacareEnrollment _Thumbnail.png" alt="" width="300" height="179" class="image-right"/></a>
                                    <p>Lying by adjusting the scales of an axis was a common theme presented by several participants of VisLies this year. <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~grinstei/" target="_blank">Georges Grinstein</a> kicked the theme off with this quite missleading visualization &quot;demonstrating&quot; the failure of the Obama administration in meeting their ACA enrollment goals. Although the difference looks quite large, in fact the numbers are very similar (within 15% of each other). The problem is that the Y-axis does not go all the way to zero. Instead, it is just some arbitrary number slightly less than 6,000,000, which makes the left bar disproportionally small. This graphic that Georges showed is a modification of one originally designed and used by Fox News. It has since been critiqued and ridiculed by many web denizens including <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/31/dishonest-fox-charts-obamacare-enrollment-editi/198679">this blog by Samantha Wyatt on Media Matters</a>. </p>
                                  </div>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="TrumpBarChart.jpg"><img src="TrumpBarChart_Thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="295" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p><a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~cnlauer/" target="_blank">Claire Lauer</a> <strong>(double check this!)</strong> continued the theme when she showed us a series of bar charts produced by presidential candidate Donald Trump's campain such as the one shown here. Most of these bar charts, including the one shown here, feature a diminishing bar. As is well described in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-charts/">a recent Washington Post article</a>, the visual implication is that the baseline of the bars is at the bottom of the image, but in fact that baseline is in some arbitrary location. It makes the size of the bars effectively meaningless. Insignificant differences can be made as large as you like.</p>
								    <p>Interestingly, the use of these floating baselines is so pervasive that Trump's campain occasionally made bars that visually diminished Trump's lead. It goes to show that the graphic designers often paid little attention to the size of the bars. They just drew bars and wrote numbers in them.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="ActiveBlocksBroken.svg"><img src="ActiveBlocksBroken.svg" alt="" width="300" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>Poor axis scaling is not always with bar charts, and it is not always intentional. Careless axis scaling makes it easy to lie to yourself. Consider the example presented by <a href="http://www.kennethmoreland.com" target="_blank">Ken Moreland</a> that was generated as part of the work for a technical report. The plot shows the number of blocks generated by an adaptive mesher in a shock physics simulation. As the material in the simulation tends to fragment, it was expected that the number of blocks required to represent them would go up, but the plot shows the number of blocks going down.</p>
								    <p>It is a curous effect and the authors spent some time hypothosizing why this occured. However, although it looks like there is a sudden drop, this is less than 0.03% of the total number. This plot was created with an R plotting package that, like most plotting software, chose an axis range based on the minimum and maximum values. This leads to a plot that consists of essentially all noise.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="ActiveBlocksFixed.svg"><img src="ActiveBlocksFixed.svg" alt="" width="300" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>The corrected plot is shown here. With the Y axis appropriately scaled with a 0 baseline, it is now clearly shown that the variance in the data is insignificant.</p>
								    <p>This is a cautionary tale to be on the lookout for bad default values from plotting software. It is also a call to plotting software to be more careful about the default scaling.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="GlobalTemperature.png"><img src="GlobalTemperature_Thumbnail.png" alt="" width="400" height="440" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>The previous examples show mistakes in zooming in on an axis that exaggerate differences and lends credence to noise. But poor axis scaling can also serve to hide important details. <a href="http://www.kennethmoreland.com" target="_blank">Ken Moreland</a> presented this over the top example that was originally comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/NRO/status/676516015078039556/photo/1">a twitter post by <em>National Review</em></a>.</p>
								    <p>This plot shows the average global temperature, but look closely at the Y-axis. (You can click on the image to get a larger version.) The axis inexplicably goes from -10&deg;F to 110&deg;F. Is it really necessary to include temperature ranges that feature a completely frozen surface to boiling oceans? We'd all be dead well before then. Instead, it only serves to zoom out the data to hide significant changes.</p>
								    <p>Twitter viewers were quick to catch on to this trick to hide data that do not agree with the point they are trying to make, and there were several humourous responses on twitter demonstrating that. Below are three examples that &quot;show&quot; how federal debt, mass shooting, and world population are not growing problems after all.</p>
								  </div>
								  <p><a href="FederalDebt.png"><img src="FederalDebt.png" alt="" class="image-third"/></a><a href="MassShooting.jpg"><img src="MassShooting.jpg" alt="" class="image-third"/></a><a href="WorldPopulation.png"><img src="WorldPopulation.png" alt="" class="image-third"/></a></p>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="GeicoCheese.jpg"><img src="GeicoCheese_Threshold.jpg" alt="" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>The previous examples examples	distort	data	by	adjusting	an	axis	to	a range larger or smaller than it should be. But another way to lie is to simply fabricate a nonsensical axis. This is probably most common in advertisements, which are not typically held to the same standards. <a href="http://www.kennethmoreland.com" target="_blank">Ken Moreland</a> showed this example ad for Geico insurance.</p>
								    <p>Putting aside the bizare decision to make bar charts out of cheese (what does cheese have to do with auto insurance?) take a look at the axis used to scale the height of the cheese-bars. Having high customer satisfaction and always available agents are certainly good qualities, but not something easily quantified on an axis. But what is so special about being established in 1936? Is that necessarily better than starting in 1926 or 1966? And why is being the 2nd-largest better than &quot;the other guy.&quot; Is being the 2nd-largest somehow better than both the 1st-largest and 3rd-largest?</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="image-constrain"> <a href="GeicoPopcorn.jpg"><img src="GeicoPopcorn_Threshold.jpg" alt="" class="image-right"/></a>
								    <p>Apparently cheese is not enough. Geico soon followed up their advertisement with this similar one featuring popcorn and the exact same nonsensical axis. Perhaps the best part of this image is that Geico has doubled down on the VisLie by coupling this nonsensical axis with a comparison of area. The well known problem with using area to represent values is that, unlike length, people do not interpret the difference in areas linearly. The combination of the nonsensical axis (making the difference look larger) and the use of area (making the difference look smaller) sonewhat cancel each other out.</p>
								  </div>
								  <p>&nbsp;</p>
								  <h3>Auditory Illusions</h3>
								  <p>Every year, George likes to present us with a few fun illusions. Usually these are optical illusions as these are the most common and, well, this is <em>Vis</em>Lies. But just to be different, George showed us a few auditory illusions. The most common one is the forever increasing or decreasing pitch.</p>
